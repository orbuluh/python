    "- Python closures involve functions that retain access to variables from their enclosing (lexical) scope even after the outer function has finished executing. This allows the inner function to \"close over\" those variables, accessing and manipulating them whenever it is called later. In your example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**: A closure, such as `averager` in your example, is a function (`f`) with an extended scope that includes variables (`series`) from its enclosing scope (in this case, `make_averager`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retaining Bindings**: The closure (`averager`) retains the bindings of the variables (`series`) at the time it was defined. This means `series` persists across multiple calls to `averager`, unlike local variables in typical functions that are destroyed after function execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Usage of Free Variables**: `series` in `averager` is a free variable because it is not defined locally within `averager` but is accessed and modified within its scope.\n",

    "## Decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "- The name decorator probably owes more to its use in the compiler areaâ€”a syntax tree is walked and annotated.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**: A decorator in Python is a callable (usually a function) that takes another function as an argument (the decorated function). It can modify or enhance the behavior of the decorated function and typically returns a new function or modifies the original function in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Syntax**: Using the `@decorator` syntax is equivalent to manually applying the decorator to a function using `function = decorator(function)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Functionality**: Decorators are primarily syntactic sugar that allows you to modify the behavior of functions or methods without changing their actual code. They execute immediately when the module is imported, demonstrating a distinction between import time (when decorators are applied) and runtime (when decorated functions are executed).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Immediate Execution**: Decorators are executed as soon as the module containing the decorated function is imported, even though the decorated function itself runs only when explicitly invoked.\n",
